Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the HTML, CSS, and JS needed to deploy my personal website. It also includes a photograph of me (in .JPEG format) and my resume (in .PDF format), both of which are displayed on the website. In developing the site, I mainly worked in Visual Studio Code and used the Live Server functionality for testing. I ran audits on the website for both Mobile and Desktop using Lighthouse.<br>

To build the site, I largely leveraged bootstrap classes. Listed below is all of the documentation I referenced in the development process:<br>
